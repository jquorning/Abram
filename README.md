Adaptable Bus OS as Services
---
Just a fancy name. Still wip'ping .. ;-)

The ultimate operating system (for now..) - Perhaps PanUlitimOS

* Starting Application Framework as application.
* Adding nano-kernel.
* Making it work - planning phase postponed atm.
* Rewrite OS services (network etc from Hurd) to Ada.
* Implement Ada Runtime at low level
* Inspired by; Hurd (terrible name), Darwin, XNS, Linux, AdaRT.
* Motto: Organize while wandering. Latin anyone ..?
* Add UNIX API
* Port applications (Debian style)
